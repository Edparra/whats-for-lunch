Springbot Coding Challenge
==========================

We at Springbot don't know where to eat lunch. Please build us a Ruby on Rails
app that will help us!

Requirements:

1. We need some way to create new restaurants
2. There needs to be a way to give each restaurant an overall rating on a scale
   of 1-5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest.
3. There should be some way for us to mark the last time we have visited
   the restaurant
4. When we visit the root url of the app, we want to be told what restaurant we
   should go to today. That restaurant should be chosen based on a combination
   of how much we like the restaurant and the last time we have been there. It
   is up to you to decide how that's going to happen, but I never want to be told
   to go to the same restaurant two days in a row unless there is only one
   restaurant in the system.

Extra Stuff:

* The user interface can be as basic as you want it to be; it's an internally
  facing page so no need to spend a lot of time making it pretty.
* You can code the app with a single user in mind, but bonus points if you
  write multi-user support in so that different people can rate restaurants.
  If you choose to do this please use the average rating for a restaurant
  when picking where we eat today. Fair is fair.
